# Integration Test Plan

This document outlines the integration testing approach for the Group Audio Communication App with Location Tracking.

## Overview

Integration testing verifies that the frontend components correctly communicate with the backend services through the defined API endpoints. The tests ensure that:

1. API endpoints are accessible
2. Authentication flows work correctly
3. Data is properly sent and received
4. Error handling is implemented correctly

## Test Environment Setup

The integration tests use the following components:

- Frontend React application
- Backend Node.js services
- API service classes that interface with backend endpoints
- TestIntegration component for running and visualizing tests

## Services Under Test

The integration tests cover the following services:

1. **Authentication Service**
   - Login
   - Registration
   - Profile management

2. **Group Service**
   - Group creation and management
   - Member management
   - Invitations

3. **Audio Service**
   - Audio session management
   - Real-time communication
   - Music sharing

4. **Location Service**
   - Location tracking
   - Privacy settings
   - Proximity alerts

5. **Subscription Service**
   - Plan management
   - Subscription handling

6. **Notification Service**
   - Notification delivery
   - Notification settings

## Test Execution

To run the integration tests:

1. Start the backend services
2. Launch the frontend application
3. Navigate to `/test-integration` route
4. Click "Run All Tests" to execute the test suite

## Test Scenarios

### Authentication Tests
- Verify login endpoint responds correctly
- Verify registration endpoint responds correctly
- Verify profile retrieval and updates

### Group Management Tests
- Verify group listing endpoint
- Verify group creation and updates
- Verify member management operations

### Audio Communication Tests
- Verify audio session creation and joining
- Verify audio controls (mute/unmute)
- Verify music sharing functionality

### Location Tracking Tests
- Verify location updates are sent correctly
- Verify location retrieval for group members
- Verify proximity alert functionality

### Subscription Tests
- Verify subscription plan listing
- Verify subscription management

### Notification Tests
- Verify notification retrieval
- Verify notification status updates

## Expected Results

For each test, the expected results are:

- **Success**: The endpoint responds with the expected status code and data format
- **Authorized Failure**: Endpoints correctly return 401 when accessed without authentication
- **Validation Failure**: Endpoints correctly return 400 when provided with invalid data

## Test Reporting

The TestIntegration component provides real-time reporting of test results, including:

- Test status (pending, running, success, failed)
- Detailed test results with timestamps
- Error messages for failed tests

## Troubleshooting

Common integration issues and solutions:

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify token storage and retrieval
   - Check token expiration handling

2. **CORS Issues**
   - Ensure backend has proper CORS configuration
   - Verify API base URL configuration

3. **Data Format Issues**
   - Check request payload format
   - Verify response parsing

4. **Network Connectivity**
   - Verify backend services are running
   - Check network connectivity between frontend and backend
