## Justification for Technology Choices

### Node.js & Go
The combination of Node.js and Go provides a balance between developer productivity and performance. Node.js excels at handling many concurrent connections with its event-driven architecture, making it ideal for the signaling server and API endpoints. Go complements this with high performance for compute-intensive tasks like location processing and proximity calculations.

### WebRTC & mediasoup
WebRTC is the industry standard for real-time communication, providing low-latency audio with built-in security. Mediasoup as an SFU allows for scaling to multiple participants without the bandwidth limitations of mesh topology.

### PostgreSQL & MongoDB
The combination of relational and document databases provides flexibility. PostgreSQL ensures data integrity for critical information like user accounts and subscriptions, while MongoDB allows for flexible schema evolution for user profiles and preferences.

### Kafka
For a system with real-time location updates across many users, a robust message broker is essential. Kafka provides the throughput and reliability needed for this use case, with built-in partitioning for scalability.

### Kubernetes
Given the scalability requirements, Kubernetes provides the orchestration needed to scale services independently based on load, with built-in service discovery and load balancing.

### React & Native Mobile
Using React for the web interface and native development (Kotlin/Swift) for mobile ensures the best user experience on each platform, with access to platform-specific features like background location tracking and push notifications.
