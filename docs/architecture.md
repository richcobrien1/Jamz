3. **Authentication Service**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Token management (JWT)
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Session management
   - OAuth integration for social logins

4. **Subscription Service**
   - Subscription plan management
   - Billing and payment processing
   - Subscription status tracking
   - Usage metering and limits

5. **Audio Communication Service**
   - WebRTC signaling server
   - Audio stream management
   - Music sharing coordination
   - Audio quality monitoring
   - Voice activity detection

6. **Location Service**
   - Real-time location tracking
   - Geofencing for proximity alerts
   - Location history management
   - Map data integration
   - Proximity calculations

### Data Layer

1. **User/Group Database**
   - PostgreSQL for structured data
   - Stores user profiles, group information
   - Authentication data
   - Subscription information

2. **Time-Series Database**
   - InfluxDB or TimescaleDB
   - Stores location history
   - Performance metrics
   - Usage statistics

3. **Redis Cache**
   - Session data
   - Real-time user status
   - Temporary location data
   - WebSocket connection management

4. **Blob Storage**
   - User profile images
   - Group avatars
   - Shared music files (if applicable)
   - Voice recordings (if applicable)

### External Services

1. **Push Notification Service**
   - Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android
   - Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for iOS
   - Web Push API for browsers

## Communication Patterns

1. **REST API**
   - Used for standard CRUD operations
   - User management, group management, subscription management
   - Authentication and authorization

2. **WebSockets**
   - Real-time bidirectional communication
   - User status updates
   - Location updates
   - Group membership changes

3. **WebRTC**
   - Peer-to-peer audio communication
   - Uses STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal
   - Signaling via WebSockets

4. **Message Queue**
   - Asynchronous communication between services
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Kafka or RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery

## Security Architecture

   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication
   - API key management for service-to-service communication

2. **Data Encryption**
   - TLS/SSL for all HTTP/WebSocket connections
   - SRTP for WebRTC audio encryption
   - End-to-end encryption for audio communication
   - At-rest encryption for sensitive data

3. **Privacy Protection**
   - Data minimization principles
   - User consent management
   - Configurable privacy settings
   - Automatic data expiration

## Scalability Architecture

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Containerized microservices (Docker)
   - Kubernetes for orchestration
   - Auto-scaling based on load
   - Regional deployment for reduced latency

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Read replicas for high-read workloads
   - Sharding for location data
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Multi-level caching
   - Distributed cache with Redis
   - Cache invalidation patterns
   - TTL-based expiration

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Logging**
   - Centralized logging with ELK stack
   - Structured logging format
   - Log retention policies
   - Error alerting

2. **Metrics**
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Custom dashboards for key metrics
   - SLA monitoring

3. **Tracing**
   - Distributed tracing with Jaeger
   - Request correlation IDs
   - Performance bottleneck identification
   - Service dependency mapping

## Disaster Recovery

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Regular database backups
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Cross-region replication
   - Backup verification

2. **Failover Mechanisms**
   - Active-passive deployment
   - Automatic failover
   - Circuit breakers
   - Graceful degradation

## Deployment Architecture
