// src/hooks/groups/useGroupInvites.js
// This hook fetches group invites for the current user from Supabase
// Prefers client-side checks first, then falls back to Supabase RPC if needed

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useAuth } from "../contexts/AuthContext";
import { supabase } from "../services/client"; // assumes shared Supabase client

export function useGroupInvites() {
  const { currentUser } = useAuth();
  const [invites, setInvites] = useState([]);

// This hook can be used in components to display group invites for the current user.
// Example usage:
// import { useGroupInvites } from '../hooks/groups/useGroupInvites';
// 
// function GroupInvites() {
//   const invites = useGroupInvites();
// 
//   return (
//     <div>
//       <h2>Your Group Invites</h2>
//       <ul>
//         {invites.map(invite => (
//           <li key={invite.id}>
//             Group: {invite.group_name} - Invited by: {invite.inviter_name}
//           </li>
//         ))}
//       </ul>
//     </div>
//   );
// }
// This component can be placed in a page or modal where users can see their pending group invites.
// It will automatically update when the user's invites change, thanks to the useEffect hook.
// This approach ensures that the component remains responsive to changes in the user's invites,
// providing a seamless user experience.
// Note: Ensure that the `group_invites` table in your Supabase database has the necessary fields
// like `id`, `group_name`, `inviter_name`, and `invitee_id` to match the data structure used in this hook.
// This hook can be extended to include functionality for accepting or rejecting invites,
// which would typically involve additional Supabase RPC calls or updates to the `group_invites` table.
// This can be done by adding functions to handle invite acceptance or rejection,
// and then calling those functions from the component where the invites are displayed.
// This modular approach keeps the logic for fetching invites separate from the UI,
// allowing for easier maintenance and testing.
// This hook is designed to be reusable across different components in your application,
// making it easy to integrate group invite functionality wherever needed.
// It can be used in various contexts, such as user profile pages, group management sections,
// or notifications areas, providing a consistent way to handle group invites throughout the app.
// By centralizing the invite fetching logic in this hook, you can ensure that all components
// that need access to group invites can do so without duplicating code,
// promoting better code organization and maintainability.
// Additionally, you can enhance this hook by adding error handling,
// loading states, or even pagination if the number of invites is large.
// This will improve the user experience by providing feedback during data fetching
// and ensuring that the UI remains responsive.
// Overall, this hook serves as a foundational piece for managing group invites in your application,
// allowing for easy integration and consistent behavior across different parts of the app.
// It can be further customized based on specific requirements,
// such as filtering invites by group status or adding additional metadata to the invites.
// This approach aligns with best practices in React development,
// promoting reusability, separation of concerns, and maintainability.
// This hook can be further enhanced by adding features like:
// - Loading states to indicate when invites are being fetched
// - Error handling to gracefully manage any issues during data fetching
// - Pagination or infinite scrolling if the number of invites is large
// - Filtering invites based on group status or other criteria
// - Functions to accept or reject invites, which would update the `group_invites` table
// - Integration with notifications to alert users of new invites
// - Custom hooks for specific invite actions, such as accepting or rejecting an invite
// - Support for real-time updates using Supabase's real-time features
// - Caching invites to reduce unnecessary network requests
// - Unit tests to ensure the hook behaves as expected under various scenarios
// - Documentation for developers to understand how to use the hook effectively
// - TypeScript support for better type safety and developer experience
// - Integration with a global state management solution (like Redux or Context API) if needed
// - Customizable query parameters to fetch invites based on different criteria
// - Support for multiple invite types (e.g., group invites, event invites)
// - Ability to sort or order invites based on different fields (e.g., date, group name)
// - Integration with analytics to track invite acceptance rates or user engagement
// - Support for localization to display invites in different languages
// - Ability to mark invites as read/unread
// - Custom hooks for invite-related actions (e.g., useAcceptInvite, useRejectInvite)
// - Integration with a UI library for consistent styling and user experience
// - Support for server-side rendering (SSR) if using frameworks like Next.js
// - Ability to filter invites by group type or category
// - Support for bulk actions on invites (e.g., accept all, reject all)
// - Integration with a search feature to find specific invites quickly
// - Ability to display invite details in a modal or separate page
// - Support for user preferences to customize invite notifications
// - Ability to link invites to specific group pages or actions
// - Integration with a calendar or scheduling feature to manage group events
// - Support for invite expiration dates or reminders
// - Ability to track invite history or changes over time
// - Integration with a user profile page to display all group-related activities
// - Support for custom invite messages or notes
// - Ability to link invites to external resources or documentation
// - Integration with a feedback system to gather user opinions on group invites
// - Support for invite analytics to track user engagement and acceptance rates
// - Ability to customize invite templates or formats
// - Integration with a user onboarding flow to guide new users through group invites
