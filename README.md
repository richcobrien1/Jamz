# Jamz
Jamz is a web, iPhone, Android app that connects to TrafficJamz service platform that provides a group of subscribed-connected active group users with audio communications including music to be able in real-time hear and speak to each other anytime. Plus real-time location service so they can track where each other is at any time. An example use case is a group of skiers who can talk and listen to music together as a group and anywhere they are on the mountain.

Of-course we would need native Galaxy and iPhone apps for communications and location service.

Phone apps would need a way to mute both microphone and speakers separately or both when necessary.

Location service should allow for audio speech to provide proximity distance between group member. Obviously the app is designed to provide location management amongst the group members so they can effortlessly find each other when they get separated.

Security is also critical in that audio and location data must be kept secret to only those group members.

As this is a subscriber service scalability is top priority.
